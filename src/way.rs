    /// Each of these are Unicode strings of up to 255 characters. For example,
    /// `highway=residential` defines the way as a road whose main function is
    /// to give access to people's homes. An element cannot have 2 tags with the
    /// same `key`, the key's must be unique. For example, you cannot have an
    /// element tagged both `amenity=restaurant` and `amenity=bar`.

    /// There is no fixed dictionary of tags, but there are many conventions
    /// documented on this wiki (starting with the Map Features page). Tag usage
    /// can be measured with the Taginfo application. If there is more than one
    /// way to tag a given feature, it's probably best to use the most common
    /// approach.

    /// ways. Both ways and nodes may be untagged if they are members of a
