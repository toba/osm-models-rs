    /// element tagged both `amenity=restaurant` and `amenity=bar`.
    ///
    /// There is no fixed dictionary of tags, but there are many conventions
    /// documented on this wiki (starting with the Map Features page). Tag usage
    /// can be measured with the Taginfo application. If there is more than one
    /// way to tag a given feature, it's probably best to use the most common
    /// approach.

    /// Not all elements have tags. Nodes are often untagged if they are part of
